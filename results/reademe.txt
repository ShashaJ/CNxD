For the LL score results:
1) Best Model: results either from MT or BCN, which is better
2) CN  : Cutset Network learned from Data only
3) CNX : Cutset Network learned from MAP intractable models via compilation only
4) CNxD: Cutset Network learned from MAP intractable models using compilation and Data
5) CNR : Cutset Network with random structure and parameters learned from BCNs

For the MAP inference result
1) BCN: Bags of Cutset Networks
2) MT: Mixture of chow_liu trees
3) CN: Cutset Network learned from Data
4) CNxD: Cutset Network learned from MAP intractable models using compilation and Data
